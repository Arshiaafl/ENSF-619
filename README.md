# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for MNIST Dataset
This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implementation using TensorFlow/Keras for generating handwritten digit images (specifically digit '7') from the MNIST dataset.

# Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other in a game framework. The generator aims to generate realistic data samples (e.g., images) from random noise, while the discriminator learns to differentiate between real and generated samples. The ultimate goal is for the generator to produce data that is indistinguishable from the real data.
